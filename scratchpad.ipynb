Its core purpose is to maintain a coherent and dynamic understanding of the ongoing conversation, the user's implicit and explicit goals, and the state of the data analysis workflow. This allows the agent to move beyond single-turn interactions and engage in natural, multi-turn dialogues.\n",

        "2.  **Action Planner/Reasoning Engine:**\n",
        "    *   **Accesses:** The entire `Session` object, especially `workflow_state` (current data, transformations, models), `nlp_artifacts` (current intent/entities), `user_preferences` (for default settings).\n",

        "### 5. Facilitating Core Intelligent Features with the Context Management System\n",
        "\n",
        "The Context Management System (CMS) is not merely a storage unit; it's the intelligence backbone that enables the agent to exhibit smart, human-like interaction. It actively facilitates several key intelligent features:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A. Anaphora Resolution:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **How CMS Helps:** Anaphora resolution is the process of determining what a pronoun or noun phrase refers to (e.g., \"it,\" \"that,\" \"the previous plot\"). The CMS provides the necessary historical data to resolve these references.\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:**\n",
        "    *   **Conversational History:** When NLU encounters an anaphor, it first looks at recent `ConversationTurn` objects. For example, if the user says \"plot *it*,\" the NLU can check `workflow_state.visualization_outputs` or `workflow_state.current_variables` from the immediately preceding turn to identify the most likely antecedent (e.g., the last generated plot or the last mentioned DataFrame/column).\n",
        "    *   **Resolved References in NLP Artifacts:** Once an anaphor is resolved, the `ConversationTurn.resolved_references` (and potentially `NLPState.last_known_subject`) are updated, making this information available for subsequent turns. For instance, if \"it\" was resolved to \"customer_age_column\", the CMS effectively stores this mapping.\n",
        "    *   **Workflow State:** The `workflow_state.active_dataframes` and `workflow_state.current_variables` contain concrete references to objects or data structures that can serve as antecedents.\n",
        "*   **Example:**\n",
        "    *   **User:** \"Load `sales_data.csv`.\" (CMS stores `active_dataframes: {'sales_data': <df_id>}`)\n",
        "    *   **User:** \"Show me the distribution of `price` in *it*.\" (NLU queries CMS for `it`, finds `sales_data` from `active_dataframes` and successfully resolves \"it\" to `sales_data`.)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. Disambiguation:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **How CMS Helps:** User requests can be ambiguous. The CMS provides context to help the agent choose the most probable interpretation.\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:**\n",
        "    *   **Active DataFrames/Schemas:** If a user says \"plot `age`,\" and there are multiple DataFrames loaded each with an 'age' column, the CMS (specifically `workflow_state.active_dataframes` and `workflow_state.dataframe_schemas`) indicates which DataFrame is currently in focus or most recently interacted with, helping NLU prioritize the correct 'age' column.\n",
        "    *   **Identified Intents and Entities:** The historical sequence of `identified_intent` and `extracted_entities` within `conversational_history` can suggest the user's current focus. If previous turns were about data cleaning, an ambiguous command like \"remove `X`\" is more likely to mean `remove_outliers(X)` rather than `remove_feature(X)`.\n",
        "    *   **User Preferences:** User-defined preferences (`user_preferences`) can guide disambiguation (e.g., if the user prefers scatter plots, an ambiguous \"compare X and Y\" might default to a scatter plot).\n",
        "*   **Example:**\n",
        "    *   **User:** \"Load `df1` and `df2`.\" (Both have a column named `ID`).\n",
        "    *   **User:** \"Show me `ID`.\" (Agent queries CMS, sees `df2` was the most recently loaded/active, and clarifies: \"Do you mean `ID` from `df1` or `ID` from `df2`?\" or defaults to `df2.ID` based on recency/preferences).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### C. Proactive Suggestions (for NLU and NLG components):\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **How CMS Helps:** The CMS provides a dynamic understanding of the current state, allowing the agent to anticipate user needs and offer helpful suggestions or generate more informative responses.\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:**\n",
        "    *   **Workflow State:** The `workflow_state` is continuously monitored. If data has just been loaded, the CMS allows the NLU/Recommender System to suggest typical next steps like \"Would you like to see `df.info()` or descriptive statistics?\" or for NLG to incorporate this into its response: \"Data loaded successfully. *You might want to check its `.info()` method next*.\"\n",
        "    *   **Model States:** If a model has just been trained, the CMS (via `workflow_state.trained_models`) enables the agent to proactively suggest evaluation metrics or visualization of residuals/feature importance. NLG can then generate a report including these suggestions.\n",
        "    *   **Pattern Recognition (from Conversational History):** Over time, if the agent learns (from `conversational_history`) that a user always performs `df.head()` followed by `df.describe()`, it can proactively suggest `df.describe()` after `df.head()` is executed.\n",
        "    *   **User Goals/Preferences:** If the CMS has inferred the user's primary goal (e.g., classification), it can suggest classification-specific features or models. For NLG, this means framing explanations in the context of classification performance.\n",
        "*   **Example:**\n",
        "    *   **Agent:** (after data loading) \"Data loaded. *Would you like to get descriptive statistics or check for missing values?*\"\n",
        "    *   **Agent:** (after model training) \"Model `LogisticRegression_1` trained with AUC of 0.85. *Would you like to see the confusion matrix or feature importances?*\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging the rich and structured information within the CMS, the agent can achieve a significantly higher level of intelligence, making interactions more seamless, efficient, and truly collaborative."

This prioritization is essential for democratizing data analysis, reducing manual effort, enabling intelligent interaction, and providing intelligent guidance, effectively forming the agent's core interactive \"interface layer.\"\n",
        "*   **NLU Architecture Design**:\n",
        "    *   **Key Functions**: NLU will focus on intent recognition (e.g., 'load data', 'plot distribution'), entity extraction (e.g., file paths, column names), disambiguation, and mapping these to internal API calls.\n",
        "    *   **Proposed Architecture**: A hybrid approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for initial intent recognition and broad entity extraction, complemented by fine-tuned smaller models or rule-based systems for specialized and validated entity extraction. It includes an intent-to-action mapping layer and integrates with the context management system.\n",
        "*   **NLG Architecture Design**:\n",
        "    *   **Key Functions**: NLG will be responsible for generating explanations, code snippets (Python), confirmations, clarifying questions, suggestions, reports, and interactive prompts.\n",
        "    *   **Proposed Architecture**: Also a hybrid approach, using LLMs for complex, free-form explanations and summaries, combined with template-based generation for structured outputs like code. It features a contextualization module, a dedicated code generation engine, and a formatting layer.\n",
        "*   **Context Management System (CMS) Design**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: The CMS acts as the agent's short-term memory, enabling coherent, multi-turn dialogues, supporting complex data science workflows, facilitating intelligent reasoning, and enhancing user experience.\n",
        "    *   **Information Stored**: It stores conversational history (user/agent utterances), NLP artifacts (intents, entities, resolved references), the data science workflow state (active DataFrames, schemas, transformations, models, visualizations, generated code), user preferences, and session metadata.\n",
        "    *   **Structure & Processes**: Utilizes a session-based, hierarchical, and structured object approach (e.g., `Session`, `ConversationTurn`, `WorkflowState` objects) stored in-memory for active sessions and serialized for persistence. It includes defined processes for updating context after NLU processing and action execution, and for retrieving context by NLU, NLG, and the action planner.\n",
        "    *   **Enabling Intelligence**: The CMS is crucial for enabling anaphora resolution (e.g., understanding \"it\" or \"that\"), disambiguating ambiguous user requests, and facilitating proactive suggestions for next steps or relevant analyses by both NLU and NLG components.\n",
        "*   **Interoperability**: The design emphasizes seamless integration points: NLU output (structured operations) feeds into the data science backend, the backend's results feed into NLG for communication, and NLG outputs influence subsequent user inputs, creating a continuous feedback loop. The CMS serves as a central hub, ensuring all components operate with contextual awareness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The hybrid architecture, combining the broad understanding of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and rule-based systems, appears to be a robust approach for balancing flexibility and accuracy in both NLU and NLG.\n",
        "*   A critical next step involves defining the specific technologies and frameworks (e.g., which LLMs, NLP libraries, database solutions for context persistence) to implement these architectural components, followed by prototyping key interaction flows to validate the design.\n"

        "### 4. Adaptation, Improvement, and Personalization Mechanisms\n",
        "\n",
        "The continuous learning processes described above (from user interactions, code execution outcomes, and expert feedback) will drive the agent's self-evolution through several adaptive mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A. Adapting Recommendations and Suggestions\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The agent's recommender system will integrate insights from both explicit and implicit user feedback, as well as the evaluation of analytical outcomes.\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **User Preferences:** If a user consistently prefers certain visualization types (e.g., Seaborn over Matplotlib defaults) or specific preprocessing techniques (e.g., median imputation), the agent will learn these preferences and prioritize them in future suggestions. This is driven by `Implicit Feedback` (acceptance/modification) and `Explicit Feedback` (ratings).\n",
        "    *   **Contextual Relevance:** If a particular analytical approach (e.g., a specific clustering algorithm) repeatedly leads to robust and validated insights for a given data structure or problem type, the agent's `Predictive and Recommender System` will increase its likelihood of suggesting that approach in similar future scenarios. This stems from `Analytical Outcome Evaluation`.\n",
        "    *   **Proactive Guidance:** By tracking common workflows from `Implicit Feedback` (navigation patterns) and identifying optimal sequences from `Analytical Outcome Evaluation`, the agent can proactively suggest the next most logical and effective step in the data science pipeline.\n",
        "*   **Example:** After data loading, if the agent observes that for similar datasets, users often perform missing value imputation followed by outlier detection, it will suggest this sequence. If the user always accepts this, the suggestion is reinforced.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. Improving Code Quality and Robustness\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The code generation engine will directly leverage lessons learned from `Code Execution and Validation`, along with user modifications (`Explicit Feedback`).\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **Error Reduction:** If certain generated code patterns frequently lead to runtime errors or warnings (identified by `Automated Testing`), the agent will learn to modify its templates or logic to produce more robust code, potentially adding more error handling or pre-computation checks.\n",
        "    *   **Efficiency Enhancement:** Patterns identified as resource-intensive or slow (`Performance Metrics`) will be deprioritized, and the agent will favor or develop more optimized alternatives.\n",
        "    *   **Best Practices Integration:** User corrections or expert feedback can directly update code generation rules to align with current best practices (e.g., using `apply` vs. `for` loops in Pandas, vectorized operations).\n",
        "*   **Example:** If the agent initially generates a `for` loop for a Pandas DataFrame operation that a user replaces with a more efficient `df.apply()` or vectorized operation, the agent will learn to generate `apply` for similar future tasks, or if a generated machine learning pipeline consistently underperforms, the agent learns to suggest alternative models or hyperparameter tuning strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### C. Personalizing Assistance and Explanations\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The NLU/NLG components will adapt their communication style, verbosity, and level of detail based on inferred user expertise and preferences.\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **User Expertise:** Through `Implicit Feedback` (e.g., successful execution of complex code, absence of clarifying questions) and potentially `Explicit Feedback` (user self-declaration of expertise), the agent can infer a user's skill level. For novices, NLG will generate more detailed explanations and simpler code. For experts, it will be more concise and assume greater familiarity with data science concepts.\n",
        "    *   **Preferred Communication Style:** If a user consistently asks for more detail (`Follow-up Questions/Clarifications`) or rates highly verbose explanations, the agent will adjust its `NLG` verbosity. Conversely, for users who prefer brevity, explanations will be shortened.\n",
        "    *   **Domain-Specific Language:** If `Explicit Feedback` or `Implicit Feedback` (e.g., use of specific terminology in queries) indicates a user works in a particular domain, the agent can adapt its explanations and examples to use relevant domain-specific language.\n",
        "*   **Example:** For a new user, when describing a correlation matrix, the agent might explain what correlation means. For an experienced user, it might simply state the key correlations and their implications. If a user always edits generated plots to add a specific title format or color palette, the agent will learn to incorporate these stylistic choices.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The continuous learning processes described above (from user interactions, code execution outcomes, and expert feedback) will drive the agent's self-evolution through several adaptive mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A. Adapting Recommendations and Suggestions\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The agent's recommender system will integrate insights from both explicit and implicit user feedback, as well as the evaluation of analytical outcomes.\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **User Preferences:** If a user consistently prefers certain visualization types (e.g., Seaborn over Matplotlib defaults) or specific preprocessing techniques (e.g., median imputation), the agent will learn these preferences and prioritize them in future suggestions. This is driven by `Implicit Feedback` (acceptance/modification) and `Explicit Feedback` (ratings).\n",
        "    *   **Contextual Relevance:** If a particular analytical approach (e.g., a specific clustering algorithm) repeatedly leads to robust and validated insights for a given data structure or problem type, the agent's `Predictive and Recommender System` will increase its likelihood of suggesting that approach in similar future scenarios. This stems from `Analytical Outcome Evaluation`.\n",
        "    *   **Proactive Guidance:** By tracking common workflows from `Implicit Feedback` (navigation patterns) and identifying optimal sequences from `Analytical Outcome Evaluation`, the agent can proactively suggest the next most logical and effective step in the data science pipeline.\n",
        "*   **Example:** After data loading, if the agent observes that for similar datasets, users often perform missing value imputation followed by outlier detection, it will suggest this sequence. If the user always accepts this, the suggestion is reinforced.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. Improving Code Quality and Robustness\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The code generation engine will directly leverage lessons learned from `Code Execution and Validation`, along with user modifications (`Explicit Feedback`).\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **Error Reduction:** If certain generated code patterns frequently lead to runtime errors or warnings (identified by `Automated Testing`), the agent will learn to modify its templates or logic to produce more robust code, potentially adding more error handling or pre-computation checks.\n",
        "    *   **Efficiency Enhancement:** Patterns identified as resource-intensive or slow (`Performance Metrics`) will be deprioritized, and the agent will favor or develop more optimized alternatives.\n",
        "    *   **Best Practices Integration:** User corrections or expert feedback can directly update code generation rules to align with current best practices (e.g., using `apply` vs. `for` loops in Pandas, vectorized operations).\n",
        "*   **Example:** If the agent initially generates a `for` loop for a Pandas DataFrame operation that a user replaces with a more efficient `df.apply()` or vectorized operation, the agent will learn to generate `apply` for similar future tasks, or if a generated machine learning pipeline consistently underperforms, the agent learns to suggest alternative models or hyperparameter tuning strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### C. Personalizing Assistance and Explanations\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The NLU/NLG components will adapt their communication style, verbosity, and level of detail based on inferred user expertise and preferences.\n",
        "*   **How it Adapts:**\n",
        "    *   **User Expertise:** Through `Implicit Feedback` (e.g., successful execution of complex code, absence of clarifying questions) and potentially `Explicit Feedback` (user self-declaration of expertise), the agent can infer a user's skill level. For novices, NLG will generate more detailed explanations and simpler code. For experts, it will be more concise and assume greater familiarity with data science concepts.\n",
        "    *   **Preferred Communication Style:** If a user consistently asks for more detail (`Follow-up Questions/Clarifications`) or rates highly verbose explanations, the agent will adjust its `NLG` verbosity. Conversely, for users who prefer brevity, explanations will be shortened.\n",
        "    *   **Domain-Specific Language:** If `Explicit Feedback` or `Implicit Feedback` (e.g., use of specific terminology in queries) indicates a user works in a particular domain, the agent can adapt its explanations and examples to use relevant domain-specific language.\n",
        "*   **Example:** For a new user, when describing a correlation matrix, the agent might explain what correlation means. For an experienced user, it might simply state the key correlations and their implications. If a user always edits generated plots to add a specific title format or color palette, the agent will learn to incorporate these stylistic choices.\n",

        "\n",
        "The primary goal of this intelligent agent is to **democratize advanced data analysis** by serving as a \"co-pilot\" for data professionals. It aims to significantly reduce manual effort and expertise by automating end-to-end data science workflows, providing intelligent guidance, generating actionable insights, and enhancing reproducibility. It will be capable of tasks ranging from data acquisition and cleaning to advanced modeling, visualization, and report generation, all through intuitive natural language interaction.\n",

        "\n",
        "These three components form the agent's interactive interface and memory, enabling natural, multi-turn dialogues and context-aware actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** To interpret complex natural language requests, identify user intent (e.g., 'load data', 'plot distribution'), and extract relevant entities (e.g., file paths, column names, parameters).\n",
        "    *   **Architecture:** Employs a hybrid approach, using large language models (LLMs) for initial intent classification and broad entity extraction, complemented by fine-tuned smaller models or rule-based systems for precise domain-specific entity extraction and validation. It includes an **intent-to-action mapping layer** to translate NLU outputs into structured data science operations.\n",
        "    *   **Integration:** Relies heavily on the **Context Management System** for disambiguation (e.g., resolving ambiguous column names by consulting the active DataFrame schema) and anaphora resolution (e.g., understanding \"it\" based on previous mentions).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Natural Language Generation (NLG):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** To produce clear, concise, and contextually relevant responses, executable code snippets (primarily Python), explanations of analysis results, clarifying questions, and summary reports.\n",
        "    *   **Architecture:** Also utilizes a hybrid approach: LLMs generate complex, free-form explanations and summaries, while template-based systems handle structured outputs like code, confirmations, and simple status updates, ensuring accuracy and consistency. It features a **code generation engine** and a **contextualization module**.\n",
        "    *   **Integration:** Receives results and insights from the data science backend, leverages the **Context Management System** to tailor explanations and suggestions to the current workflow state and user history, and generates outputs that feed back into the NLU as potential next user inputs.\n",

        "4.  **Data Science Backend Execution:** The agent executes the necessary Python code (generated by the **Code Generation Engine**, potentially refined by the **Code Generation Refinement Engine**) in a sandboxed environment. This execution is monitored for performance and errors, providing **Code Execution and Validation** feedback.\n",
        "5.  **Context Update:** The CMS is updated with the results of the execution, including changes to DataFrames, new models, or visualizations.\n",
        "6.  **NLG Generation:** The NLG component (using LLMs and templates) generates a human-readable response, explanations of outcomes (informed by **Analytical Outcome Evaluation** results), and potentially follow-up questions. This generation is contextualized by the CMS and personalized by the **Personalization Engine**. The **RLHF Agent** continuously improves the quality of these generative outputs based on user feedback.\n",
        "7.  **Output to User:** The agent presents the explanation, code, visualizations, or new query to the user.\n",
        "8.  **Feedback Capture:** User interaction with this output (acceptance, modification, rating) is captured by the **Feedback Loop Mechanism**, feeding back into the **Adaptation Engines** and **Knowledge Base**, thus closing the continuous learning and evolution loop.\n",

        "    *   **Justification:** These models offer state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding, excelling at complex intent recognition, handling diverse phrasing, and performing broad entity extraction without extensive fine-tuning. Their strong zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities are ideal for understanding varied user requests in a data science context, often grasping nuances that smaller models might miss. They are well-suited for the initial, high-level interpretation of user input, serving as a robust front-end for NLU.\n",
        "    *   **Pros:** High accuracy, strong generalization, excellent contextual understanding, reduces initial development effort for diverse intents.\n",

        "    *   **Justification:** For scenarios where cost or data privacy is a primary concern, or for specific, highly repetitive intents, a smaller, fine-tuned open-source LLM can serve as a valuable complement or fallback. These models can be self-hosted and fine-tuned on domain-specific data science interactions to achieve high performance for particular tasks.\n",

It's highly efficient and provides pre-trained models for NER, dependency parsing, and tokenization. Crucially, `spaCy` also excels at rule-based matching (e.g., `Matcher`, `PhraseMatcher`), which is invaluable for identifying highly specific and structured entities (like file paths, exact column names, specific algorithm names, or data types) that might not be reliably extracted by general-purpose LLMs without extensive fine-tuning.\n",
        "    *   **Application:** Will be used for extracting data identifiers (e.g., `sales_data.csv`, `/path/to/file`), column/feature names (e.g., `customer_age`, `revenue`), specific data science method parameters (e.g., `impute with mean`, `plot as scatter`), and validating their format or existence against the current `WorkflowState`.\n",

It's highly effective for finding semantic similarity between user queries and known intents/entities, or for mapping vaguely described entities to canonical forms. While LLMs handle this broadly, `sentence-transformers` can be fine-tuned on data science domain-specific examples to improve the accuracy of matching user language to internal representations.\n",

This offers a balance between flexibility and precision.\n",

        "    *   **`Sentence-Transformers`:** For entities where the user's phrasing might be less direct, `sentence-transformers` will be employed to find semantic similarity.

        "    *   **Smaller, Fine-tuned Transformer Models:** For more complex, less-structured entities specific to data science sub-domains (e.g., specific feature engineering techniques described in a novel way), a fine-tuned BERT/RoBERTa model could provide more accurate extraction than a general LLM without the overhead.\n",
        "    *   **Context Management System Integration:** During this stage, these specialized modules will query the `Context Management System` (CMS). For instance, when validating a column name, the CMS provides the schema of the `active_dataframes`. For anaphora resolution (e.g., \"plot *that* column\"), the CMS provides the reference from previous turns.\n",

        "3.  **Intent-to-Action Mapping and Disambiguation (Logic Layer with CMS Interaction):**\n",
        "    *   Once the intent is refined and entities are precisely extracted and validated, a dedicated mapping layer translates this structured NLU output into specific internal data science API calls or workflow orchestrations.\n",
        "    *   **Disambiguation:** If ambiguity still exists after the specialized extraction (e.g., two loaded dataframes have a column with the same name), this layer will leverage the `Context Management System` (e.g., `workflow_state.last_active_dataframe`, `conversational_history`) to resolve it, or generate clarifying questions via NLG if necessary. The `Recommendation and Strategy Optimization Engine` can also inform disambiguation by suggesting the most probable interpretation based on learned patterns.\n",

        "The NLU component's implementation details and outcomes demonstrate a robust, multi-faceted approach ready for integration. It leverages both large language models (LLMs) and specialized natural language processing (NLP) techniques, integrated with a Context Management System (CMS), to accurately interpret user requests and translate them into executable data science actions. Its core capabilities include precise intent recognition, detailed entity extraction, and a structured mapping layer, all designed to maintain conversational context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Environment Setup Completed**: All necessary Python libraries for NLU, including `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`, `datasets`, `google-generativeai`, and `openai`, were successfully installed. `bitsandbytes` required explicit installation, while others were mostly pre-existing.\n",
        "*   **Hybrid NLU Model Selection**:\n",
        "    *   **LLMs for Broad Understanding**: Proprietary models (e.g., Google's Gemini Pro via `google-generativeai`, OpenAI's GPT-4 via `openai`) were chosen as primary for initial intent recognition and broad entity extraction due to their high accuracy and generalization. Open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B, Llama-2-7B via `transformers`) serve as a cost-effective fallback or complement.\n",
        "    *   **Specialized NLP for Precision**: `spaCy` was selected for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and rule-based matching for highly structured entities (e.g., file paths, column names). `Sentence-Transformers` were chosen for semantic similarity (e.g., fuzzy matching), alongside custom rule-based systems and fine-tuned smaller transformer models for specific domain entities.\n",
        "*   **Intent Recognition Implemented**:\n",
        "    *   A comprehensive list of 15 data science intents (e.g., `load_data`, `plot_distribution`, `train_model`, `unknown_intent`) was defined.\n",
        "    *   A structured LLM system prompt was designed to classify user utterances into these intents, outputting a JSON object with `intent` and `confidence` (0.0-1.0).\n",
        "    *   The `get_intent_from_llm` function was implemented to integrate with Google Gemini Pro.\n",
        "*   **Entity Extraction Implemented**:\n",
        "    *   Ten data science entity types (e.g., `data_identifiers`, `column_names`, `method_parameters`, `visualization_types`) were defined.\n",
        "    *   A system prompt was designed for LLM-based entity extraction, returning a JSON object of categorized entities.\n",
        "    *   A rule-based extractor (`extract_rule_based_entities`) using regex patterns was implemented and debugged (resolving a `SyntaxError` in regex patterns).\n",
        "    *   A hybrid function (`get_refined_entities`) was created to combine LLM and rule-based extraction, prioritizing rule-based findings for structured entities.\n",
        "*   **NLU-CMS Integration Established**:\n",
        "    *   Placeholder classes (`Session`, `WorkflowState`, `ConversationTurn`) were defined (corrected from initial `SyntaxError` in f-strings).\n",
        "    *   The `process_user_query_with_context` function was implemented to orchestrate NLU, update session artifacts, and store conversational history, passing contextual information (like active dataframes) to the NLU models.\n",
        "*   **Intent-to-Action Mapping Layer Developed**:\n",
        "    *   The `map_nlu_to_action` function was implemented to translate identified intents and extracted entities into structured internal commands (e.g., `internal_load_data`, `internal_plot`).\n",
        "    *   This layer includes logic for inferring parameters, handling missing entities by setting a `needs_clarification` status, and leveraging `session_context` for disambiguation (e.g., inferring active dataframe).\n",
        "*   **NLU Testing Framework in Place**: Instructions were provided to the user for comprehensive testing of intent recognition, entity extraction, and action mapping, emphasizing the need to set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. The API key was successfully set in a final step.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The NLU component is designed with a strong modularity, combining the generalization power of LLMs with the precision of specialized NLP techniques and rule-based systems, which should enhance both accuracy and robustness for diverse data science tasks.\n",
        "*   While the architectural design and implementation are complete, full end-to-end functional validation of the NLU component and its integration with the Context Management System and action mapping layer is contingent on providing the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and rerunning the relevant code blocks. This is a critical next step for demonstrating its achieved capabilities.\n"

I also added `ast.literal_eval` to correctly parse the `features` list for model training. Then, I will provide the same example usage to demonstrate the corrected functionality.\n",

        "*   **Hybrid NLG Approach Established**: The Natural Language Generation (NLG) component employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini Pro (or OpenAI's GPT-4) for generating complex natural language explanations, summaries, clarifying questions, and proactive suggestions. Simultaneously, it uses template-based or rule-based methods for precise and consistent structured outputs, such as executable code snippets, confirmations, and simple prompts.\n",
        "*   **Robust Code Snippet Generation**: A core function, `generate_code_snippet`, was developed to translate structured internal commands into executable Python code for various data science tasks, including data loading, plotting (e.g., histogram, scatter plot, bar chart), data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates), model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and exploratory data analysis summaries. The function was refined to correctly handle complex parameter parsing (e.g., string representations of lists for features) and now provides syntactically correct and logically sound code.\n",
        "*   **Context-Aware Explanation and Summarization Logic**: The LLM-based explanation module (`generate_explanation_from_llm`) is guided by a comprehensive system prompt that leverages the `action_object`, `results_summary`, and a `workflow_state_snapshot` from the Context Management System (CMS). This design ensures that generated explanations, clarifications, and proactive suggestions are highly relevant to the current state of the data analysis workflow.\n",
        "*   **Seamless Integration with Context Management**: The NLG component has been successfully integrated into the `process_user_query_with_context` function. After Natural Language Understanding (NLU) identifies intent and extracts entities, the NLG is invoked to formulate the agent's natural language response, which is then stored within the conversational history, ensuring contextual flow.\n",
        "*   **Testing Framework Defined**: A clear set of instructions and evaluation criteria have been established for thoroughly testing the NLG component's accuracy, contextual relevance, clarity, and conciseness across various data science scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Actionable LLM Validation**: The primary next step is to ensure a valid Google API Key is configured. This will enable full end-to-end testing and validation of the LLM-generated explanations, clarifications, and suggestions, allowing for empirical assessment of their quality and contextual relevance.\n",
        "*   **Expand Code Snippet Coverage**: While robust, the `generate_code_snippet` function can be expanded to support a wider array of data science operations and parameters (e.g., advanced feature engineering techniques, more diverse plotting options, hyperparameter tuning in model training) to increase the agent's practical utility.\n"

        "*   All specified Python libraries for the agent's components were successfully installed; however, dependency warnings were noted during installation.\n",
        "*   The GPU was confirmed to be unavailable (`GPU available: False`) in the current Colab environment.\n",
        "*   The cloning of the GitHub repository **failed** due to unreplaced placeholder values in the provided URL and credentials. The agent identified this issue and provided detailed instructions for the user to manually correct and rerun the cloning process.\n",
        "*   The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was attempted to be loaded from Colab Secrets but was **not found**, resulting in a warning. This prevents the full initialization of LLM functionalities.\n",
        "*   The `SentenceTransformer` embedding model (`'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`) was successfully initialized. However, the Google Generative AI models (`gemini-pro`) for NLU/NLG **could not be initialized** because the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was missing.\n",
        "*   ChromaDB was successfully initialized and configured for persistent storage at `/content/drive/MyDrive/colab_persistent_storage/chromadb_store`, and an empty `agent_long_term_memory` collection was created, ready for use.\n",
